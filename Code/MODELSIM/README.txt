Simulation
1) For simulation use the tb_quicksort.v file
2) create contents of BRAM for sorting by using the BRAM_FILE_GEN code in MISC
3) Run the simulation in modelsim. 
4) At the end of the testbench run, contents of BRAM will be updated with sorted array.

Synthesis
1) Use the top_quicksort.v file for synthesis.
2) By attaching BRAM/memory, design can be run in hardware
